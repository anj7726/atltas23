        <section>
            <p>Annie's Cakes began as a small family kitchen in 1890,when our founder Annie baked her first cheesecake for her family. The taste soon turned something magical- what started as a one-time baking turned into a lifelong passion. </p>
            <p>Over the years,our recipes were perfected,passed down to generations, and loved by everyone in the neighbourhood. In 1994, we opened our first official cake shop in the heart of city, offering Delicious cakes.</p>
            <p>Today, Annie's Cakes continues to blend tradition with creativity. whether it's a birthday,wedding, or just a sweet craving,we're hre to make your moments memorable-one bite at a time.</p>
